# **LLmHub**

*The first fully free search platform built for **true collaboration**: every query is visible to the whole team, AI agents co-search alongside you, and results are summarised in real time—so decisions happen faster and duplicate work disappears.*

---

## ✨ Key Features

### Collaborative Threads  
See teammates’ live cursors, queries, and annotations—like Google Docs but for search.

### AI Co-Pilots  
LLM agents refine keywords, dedupe results, and draft summaries or next steps on demand.

### Shared Knowledge Graph  
Persist every click & note; surface **who already knows** when you revisit a topic.

### Web Bots  
Fire off searches from any page in your browser and capture results without breaking flow.

## 📚 Use-Case Recipes

### Travel Planning  
Add the **Itinerary** plugin and drop flight alerts directly into your shared board.

### Grant & Patent Landscaping  
Activate **Citation Notebook** to export IEEE/APA references with one click.

### Incident Response
